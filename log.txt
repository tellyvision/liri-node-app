I thought I lost my phone. But I was just walking in circles. My phone was hovering in air above me. I can't tell if this is weird anymore.

But then again, maybe it's not any lighter. Maybe I'm just adjusting to this fog of darkness.

I fell asleep for a while. Nightmares, not surprising. The distinction between waking and sleeping is eerily narrow. The dimness lifted more

My phone is definitely dead. I have no idea how I'm still tweeting. It's dead. It's really fucking dead. Is anyone reading this?

The dimness has lightened up and I can see these huge monolithic structures off in the distance. I can't tell how far away they are.

My phone will die soon.

There is no smell. Absolutely no smell at all. Right now that's the most alarming thing. Not damp, earthy, dusty, moldy, good, bad. Nothing.

Okay, I decided to walk towards them. I've been walking for hours, I still can't tell how close they are. Has it been hours? I can't tell.

Everything is dark. Not pitch dark, but some weird eery dimness. Enough to make the shapes around me indefinite, amorphous. Hulking, spiny.

But what is of greater loss and urgency: I have absolutely no idea, not even an inkling, where on earth I am.

I'd rather eat grass than peppers. I miss books, though I still carry a few. I'm allergic to pine trees. Fresh snow brings me joy.

A knife etched with the name of my family is always on my hip. I won't drink tea w/out honey. I can make a fire but cannot thread an arrow.

There are many things that I still know. My name is Molva. I was born at the base of a mountain, where I first bled, cried, and loved.
